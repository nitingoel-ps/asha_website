--- Notes from Moblile app development initial setup----
---- Okay problem ---
When I started my mobile app development, I learnt I need LTS (long term support) versions.
So I am getting new stuff.

This package has installed:
	•	Node.js v22.13.1 to /usr/local/bin/node
	•	npm v10.9.2 to /usr/local/bin/npm
Make sure that /usr/local/bin is in your $PATH.

Install xcode (from apple app store - also during install, ask for ios support)
brew install ruby (needed for cocoapods)
brew install cocoapods ()
brew install watchman (Facebook recommends installing thi sfor better file-watching performance)



launchctl limit maxfiles
sudo launchctl limit maxfiles 65536 524288


Do this loop at times to get the pesky too many files issue....
npm install
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

npx react-native run-ios
