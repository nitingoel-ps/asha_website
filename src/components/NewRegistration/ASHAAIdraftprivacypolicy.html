    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: April, 27, 2025</p>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <span class="emphasis">Asha AI</span> (the "App" or "Service"), offered by <span class="emphasis">Aspen Health AI Solutions</span> ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your personal information. By accessing or using Asha AI, you agree to the practices described here.</p>
    
    <h3>No HIPAA Coverage</h3>
    <p>We are <span class="emphasis">not</span> a "covered entity" or "business associate" under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Any personal health information you provide or store in Asha AI is governed by this Privacy Policy <span class="emphasis">only</span> and is <span class="emphasis">not</span> subject to HIPAA protections.</p>
    
    <h3>U.S. Residents Only</h3>
    <p>Asha AI is intended for individuals residing in the United States. If you reside outside the U.S., you acknowledge that you use the Service at your own risk and that we do not represent or warrant compliance with laws or regulations outside the U.S.</p>
    
    <h3>Age Restriction</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="emphasis">18+ Requirement</span>: Asha AI is intended for users <span class="emphasis">18 years of age or older</span>. You may not create an account if you are under 18.</li>
        <li><span class="emphasis">Parents/Guardians</span>: A parent/guardian may create and manage sub-profiles to store and access health data of their minor children (or legal dependents). By doing so, the parent/guardian represents they have the legal authority to share such data. We do not knowingly allow minors to register independently.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h2>2. Key Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="emphasis">"Personal Information"</span>: Information that can identify you, such as your name, contact info, and other unique identifiers.</li>
        <li><span class="emphasis">"PHR Data"</span>: Personal Health Record Data, including medical history, diagnoses, treatments, prescriptions, lab results, etc.</li>
        <li><span class="emphasis">"Aggregate Data"</span>: Data that has been de-identified so it cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual.</li>
        <li><span class="emphasis">"Provider"</span>: A healthcare provider, practice, or hospital that you authorize to share health data with the Service.</li>
        <li><span class="emphasis">"Authorized Individual"</span>: A parent, guardian, or another person who accesses your or your child's health data with your permission. (Note: Asha AI <span class="emphasis">currently does not</span> provide a feature for sharing your entire profile to another user's account, but parents may create sub-profiles for their dependents.)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>3.1 Account Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="emphasis">Registration</span>: We collect your name, email address, phone number, birthdate, username, and password when you create an account.</li>
        <li><span class="emphasis">Child/Dependent Profiles</span>: Parents/guardians can create sub-profiles for minors or dependents under their main account; information in these sub-profiles is also covered by this Policy.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3.2 PHR / Health Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="emphasis">User-Provided Records</span>: You may upload or manually enter health information (e.g., vitals, medications, symptoms, lab results).</li>
        <li><span class="emphasis">Provider Imports</span>: At your direction, the App may connect to a Provider's portal to retrieve your medical records. We only do this with your explicit permission and login credentials.</li>
        <li><span class="emphasis">No Guarantee of Accuracy</span>: We do not originate or verify the accuracy of medical records. We simply store and present them for your convenience. Any AI-generated insights are informational and <span class="emphasis">not</span> guaranteed accurate.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3.3 AI & Voice Services</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We use <span class="emphasis">third-party AI and voice APIs</span> (e.g., from AWS, Google, Microsoft Azure, OpenAI, Perplexity, ElevenLabs) to enable features such as search, data summarization, text-to-speech (TTS), and speech-to-text (STT).</li>
        <li><span class="emphasis">Identifiable Data</span> may be sent to these external services if you use AI-based features. By using these features, you consent to such data transfers.</li>
        <li>We do <span class="emphasis">not</span> control how these third parties handle data once they process it, though we aim to use vendors that limit or delete logs. If you prefer not to share data with these providers, do <span class="emphasis">not</span> use AI-powered features.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3.4 Usage Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="emphasis">Technical Details</span>: We collect IP addresses, device types, operating system info, and pages viewed to analyze trends and improve stability.</li>
        <li><span class="emphasis">Cookies & Tokens</span>: We may use cookies, web beacons, or session tokens to maintain sessions and remember your preferences.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3.5 Payment Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you purchase subscriptions or upgrades, a <span class="emphasis">third-party payment processor</span> handles your billing info. We do <span class="emphasis">not</span> store full credit card numbers.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3.6 Communications</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If you contact us by email or other channels, we keep copies of your messages and related metadata for support and troubleshooting.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3.7 Activity Logs</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We may track when PHR Data is accessed, modified, or shared (if that becomes a future feature) to maintain security and audit trails.</li>
